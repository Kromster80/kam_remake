<p><font face="Calibri">The KaM Remake mod is an attempt to reinvigorate the original &quot;Knights and Merchants: The Shattered Kingdom&quot; strategy game. Our goals are to make it work on today's computers and operating systems, implement a fully featured online multiplayer system, as well as to fix the many bugs in the game engine. To do this we have started from scratch, writing our own code for the game engine but still relying on many original resource files.
We assume that you own the original KaM game, (the installer checks for it) otherwise you should buy it - it's available in a number of online gaming stores.<br>
The KaM Remake executable is freeware and is built by enthusiasts. Applications used: Delphi 6, Delphi 7, FastMM4, Lazarus, LNet, OpenGL, OpenAL, Overbyte ICS, PNGImage, zLib, MadExcept, libZPlay.</font><BR>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Calibri">KaM Remake requires:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Microsoft Windows 98, XP, Vista or Seven;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - 500MHz or faster processor;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - 256MB or more of RAM;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - 3D graphics accelerator OpenGL 1.4 compliant;<br>

<B>1.</B> Run the installer and follow the installation instructions.<BR>
<B>2.</B> The installer will also install the OpenAL audio drivers (<b>oalinst.exe</b>) if they are not detected. The latest version can be found on the official OpenAL page:
<a href="http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal/default.aspx">
http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal/default.aspx</a> <br>
<B>3.</B> The KaM Remake uses the OpenGL rendering engine, so you need to have OpenGL drivers 
installed as well. Visit your graphics card manufacturer site to get the latest 
drivers available.
<br><B>4.</B> Launch the mod - KaM_Remake.exe or from the Desktop/Start Menu if you chose to create shortcuts.<br>&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Calibri">
<B>Installing add-on maps:</B><br>
<B>1.</B> Create a sub-folder in the Maps folder of the KaM Remake and name it, for example, &quot;My New Map&quot;.<br>
<B>2.</B> Put inside .dat and .map files of the map and rename them accordingly &quot;My New Map.dat&quot; and &quot;My New Map.map&quot;. 
File names should match folder name exactly.<br><B>3.</B> You can also make an 
optional file called &quot;My New Map.txt&quot; which will contain the 
mission description and other information. Use the same format as the missions provided 
with the Remake. No official format information will be released because this file will probably be changed later on.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Calibri"><b>Adding custom music:</b><br>
You can put your MP3/OGG files into the Music folder of the KaM Remake, and they will be 
included into the playlist automatically.<br>

<P><font face="Calibri"><B>Silent crashes:</B><br>
If the KaM Remake crashes silently during startup please send the log file to <a href="mailto:contact@kamremake.com">contact@kamremake.com</a> along with any other information that might be of use.<br></p>
<p><B>Low framerate:</B><br>
If you have ridiculously low framerate in game it might be because your OpenGL drivers are out of date. See the OpenGL version information in the top-left corner of the main menu, it should be at least 1.4.x. If it is less you need to update your graphics card drivers (check your card manufacturers website).<br></p>
<p><B>Game errors:</B><br>
Sometimes when something unexpected happens you will get an &quot;<i>An error has occurred in the application</i>&quot; message. Please click the <i>Send Bug Report</i> button to send the crash report to us. Enter your name and email address in the form if you would like us to be able to contact you about the crash. Having the crash report will help us to fix the bug.<br><br></p>

<font face="Calibri">Executables for the multiplayer dedicated server are included, available for Windows and Linux x86 and x86_64. The server listens for connections on a TCP port (56789 by default) and acts as a hub to trasfer the data between clients. The dedicated server does not understand gameplay, it simply moves packets around. The first client to join a room will be assigned hosting rights allowing them to setup the game. If that client disconnects, the next one in the list will be assigned hosting rights.<br>
The server can be configured from the file KaM_Remake_Settings.ini. (created on the first of the game or server) Options for the dedicated server are in the section [Server].<br>
To use in a LAN game, first make sure the server will not be published to the master server by setting "AnnounceDedicatedServer=0" in the INI file. (see above) Then start the dedicated server and ensure it is running properly (it should say "Listening on port 56789") Please ensure your firewall is allowing clients to connect to the server, by allowing TCP port 56789. (or whichever you chose) You may then connect to it from the same computer and/or other computers. (For the same computer, connect to the address 127.0.0.1 or localhost)<br>
To use on the internet, you must forward the TCP port 56789 (or whichever you chose) from your router to your PC running the dedicated server. (for more information on port forwarding visit <a href="http://portforward.com/">http://portforward.com/</a>) Tell your friends to connect to your server name from the list if you chose to make your server publicly announced, or your external IP address if not, which is displayed to you on the homepage of <a href="http://portforward.com/">http://portforward.com/</a>. If you are playing on the same computer that is running the dedicated server, or on the same LAN, connect to its IP address as you would for a LAN game.<br>
<br>
Note: The dedicated server is not required to play multiplayer. Clicking "Start Local Server" or "Start Internet Server" from the network menu has the same effect, except you must participate in the game and the server cannot be left to maintain itself. The dedicated server is only necessary if you want to provide a server without playing. The main purpose of the dedicated server is to allow servers to be hosted 24/7, which players can join and participate in any time they like. If you are able to provide this service we would be pleased.<br>
<br>
The Linux builds have been tested on Fedora and Ubuntu. Any queries or comments regarding the Linux builds should be sent to Lewin. (<a href="mailto:lewinjh@gmail.com">lewinjh@gmail.com</a>).</font>
