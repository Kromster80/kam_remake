Instructions for creating build folder:

Note: When extracting items from SVN folders use SVN Export (right click drag lets you do that) so that only SVN versioned items are taken (skips any test maps/files of your own, as well as unwanted files like .mi, .dat.txt, etc.).

1. Start with an empty folder
2. Copy 3 folders from Dropbox Castlesand folder: Campaigns, data and Music
3. Copy data\locales.txt and data\text\* (SVN versioned items only)
4. Copy data\gfx\fonts from SVN
5. Use RXX packer to generate rxx files (original .rx files are on DropBox under SpriteResource), copy rxx files to data\Sprites
6. SVN export Campaigns folder, merge with one from DropBox
7. Export items from Maps folder which should be included (todo: how do we know which ones to include?)
8. SVN export MapsMP folder
9. SVN export Readme folder into build folder (so Readme_xxx.html files are in root of build folder)
10. SVN export Sounds folder
11. SVN export tutorials folder
12. Compile Campaign Builder and put it in build folder as CampaignBuilder.exe
13. Compile TranslationManager (first remove '..\..\' from fWorkDir) and put it in build folder as TranslationManager.exe
14. Compile dedicated server on Windows and Linux x86 / x86_64 (KaM_Remake_Server_win32.exe, KaM_Remake_Server_x86, KaM_Remake_Server_x86_64)
15. Include music library dll (libzplay.dll or bass.dll)
16. Copy KM_TextIDs.inc from SVN into build folder (required for Translation Manager to work properly)
17. Create changelog from todo\bugslist.txt (leave only completed items)
18. Compile Remake and put it in build folder as KaM_Remake.exe
