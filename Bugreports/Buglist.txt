Since r2411:
<===================================================================================>
 +	Shorted "teamname %s" in lobby for PL locale
 +	Replace the "Fast Scrolling" checkbox with a slider
 +	Often warrior voices and other sounds don't play due to poor prioritizing of the available soundcard slots
 +	The "waiting for players" message would often not appear, the game would just freeze with no message
 +	Arrow keys would not scroll the map when opening menu with a TKMEditBox (e.g. chat) until you close the menu
 +	Woodcutters and others(?) should plant/chop more evenly (not in waves like now)
 +	Exporting the Sounds produced corrupt files rather than the correct sounds
 +	Wood and/or stone would not be delivered to a storehouse under construction if you had blocked them in your first storehouse
 +	Animals would often not appear in multiplayer games because they were set for a player which was unused
 +	The animation for the farmer picking grapes did not show because the anim direction used was invalid

 +	Range check erorrs when using multiple monitors
 +	Multiplayer chat only scrolls down when you are at the bottom, making it possible to read old messages without it jumping back

 +	Using a barracks near the left or top edges of the map caused an error (thanks Jecy)
 +	Due to predicting a target's position archers can shoot way beyond their range
 +	Make market interface less confusing by showing number of wares that will be taken/given
 +	Archers would often shoot into your own troops when the enemy charged you, due to predicting the enemy's position
 +	Lobby with player 1, AI, player 2. Player 1 quits, player 2 becomes host and removes AI. Player 2 can now kick himself and other strange bugs

	Replays almost always end up with a mismatch while watching them, cause unknown
	AI attacks make the game lag (by using too much CPU in pathfinding ?). Vortamic is especially bad.
	Someone joining your lobby as you click start gets an invalid state and server times out
	Campaign flags have a colored square around them when selected
	Multiplayer replays do not sync FOW so get mismatches
	Confirmation for quitting multiplayer while waiting for players should be harder to hit by accident

	The story message on campaign map should fade between sides when you mouse over, rather than jumping
 	Multiplayer should have an option to send a flare (beacon) on the minimap to tell allies (or all players) about something.
	Multiplayer mode could show the player's name above each group (flag holder)
	Mutltiplayer spectator mode, and ability for the host to close slots
	Make F8 smooth by speeding up the game clock, rather than processing multiple ticks at once

	Archers on a hill get slighty longer range (calculated from height of archer tile relative to target tile)
	Show the mining radius of the selected house or house that you are placing
	Master server in MySQL and support multiple revisions at once
	Colors for chat to highlight player names and whether it is team/all channel
	Warriors should automatically engage enemies within 3-4 tiles (same in KaM and makes chasing down archers easier)

Fixed in r734:
<===================================================================================>
+	The woodcutters planting animation is not visible, he simply disappears and reappears when he is done planting.
+	The woodcutter doesn't cut down trees, until all the available spots have been planted. In the original KaM a woodcutter would always cut down fullgrown trees in the first place, and only plant trees when there is nothing to cut down. (TRB 2010-02-19 Wood and Swine save01.sav) (trees appeared to be fully grown a few minutes before they can be cut)
+	Troop/house buttons not working after clicking on terrain with them selected
+	Laborers are sometimes being trapped inside a digged construction plan (Kuba 2010-02-19 Stuck Workers save09.sav)
+	Range check error in TPR7, (TRB 2010-02-19 Range Check Error.rar) caused by group dying

+	In game settings uses old sytle brightness control.
+	Main menu options page doesn't refresh if you change the settings in game.
+	After digging house area workers will not continue to walk over other construction sites after leaving the one they made
+	Terrain is now flattened under houses placed at mission start
+	Demolished houses now leave a dug tile where the road used to be, rather than it just disappearing which looked odd (TK's suggestion)
+	F11 statusbar shows wrong map size in loaded games
+	Because the delivery queue prefers closer deliveries, wares will always be delivered to closer buildings. (e.g. with two swine farms, closer one will get all the corn) Same with coal mines. (coal mines in Kuba 2010-02-19 Stuck Workers save09.sav, swine farms in TRB 2010-02-19 Wood and Swine save01.sav)
+	(Can't reproduce, probably caused by worker-construction site issues that have been fixed now) Walk failed in TPR7 "Unit Laborer unable to walk a route from (97;29) to (98;30) during task Idle since the route is unbuilt" (TRB 2010-02-19 Walk Failed.rar)

<===================================================================================>

+	Weapons producing houses did not show produced weapons correctly, only one weapon of each type was displayed
+	Range Check Error in GetSlide function due to PrevPos being two tiles away from NextPos (fix unconfirmed, but 99% certain) [Lewin]
+	Buggy stone mining - in some maps, e.g. 15 TSK, stonemasons get stuck after grabbing a stone, because of the changing elevation and angle (the tile below them becomes unwalkable). Building a road near the trapped stonemason causes an error message like the described before, but then nothing bad happens - he just go home and keep working.
+	Some saves are impossible to load due to the range check error (bug in TKMPointTagList.Load) [Lewin]
+	Instabilities due to rare circumstances causing routes with canWalkRoad to fail when floodfill succeeds [Lewin]
+	Demolishing the building manually exits from the building menu, unlike in KaM, where it takes back to the building selection [Lewin]
+	Load/Save buttons have different order [to KaM], it's a bit confusing [Lewin]
+	Stuck (trapped) fish (especially in "Across the Desert") would try to use canWalk to solve interaction resulting in crashes [Lewin]
+	Returning to road did not use A* efficiently and so would fail over long distances [Lewin]
