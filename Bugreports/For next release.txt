==============
 SINCE r3311:
==============
 +	Crash "GameWaitingForNetwork from wrong state lgs_None" if you quit a multiplayer game while waiting for players and start a single player game
 +	All players reported the map being played to the master server, it should have only been the host
 +	PC icon was not shown as the flag for AI players in-game (only in lobby)

	Access violation when clicking start in lobby (after reassigning host?)

==============
FIXED IN r3311
==============
 +	Some text IDs were duplicate so the text "Switch delivery of wares on/off" showed "Cost:" instead
 +	Screenshot button in menu didn't work
 +	Don't log form resizing
 +	Can't win campaign missions
 +	Blocked stonemason and released woodcutter on the map Europe, there is no stone on the map and you start with 1500
 +	Elevating in the map editor in non-square maps was buggy
 +	Removed two fan-made maps with terrain which has been partially copied from the original campaigns, we don't accept copy-paste maps
 +	Block icons when building a house near the left/top edge of the map are now rendered in the correct position
 +	"Duplicate points in list" error in multiplayer sometimes when placing a road, deleting it and placing it again
 +	Crash with "range check error" when a woodcutter tried to chop a tree near the bottom of the map
 +	Host does setup didn't reset to false if you created a new lobby, it used the value from the last lobby
 +	Focus in the chat edit in the lobby is lost when you use a drop down
 +	If the host selects a map/save you don't have (or have a different version) the lobby freezes
 +	Crash when starting if there is a closed slot above the host (due to host being reassigned)
 +	Units/trees on the edge of the map were rendered dark
 +	If a armour workshop ordered to produce shields and armour ran out of wood they would not produce armour
 +	If you try to build a mine with road being built underneth, it would show that you can't build it even though you could
 +	When installed to Program Files you no longer need administrator rights to run the game
 +	Host was never able to drop players who had disconnected, even after the 30 seconds (button stayed disabled)
 +	Join button on the multiplayer page would sometimes be enabled at the wrong times meaning you could click twice and cause a crash
 +	Double clicking in empty space on the server list would make you join the selected server
 +	Multiplayer saves were often created differently between computers
 +	It was often possible to place plans over your ally's plans, which caused a crash
 +	If two enemies placed plans over each other's, it would crash the replay
 +	Restored 4P versions of Border Rivers, Wilderness and Stranded so you can play 4P FFA with random starts
