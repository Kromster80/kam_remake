<p><font face="Calibri">KaM Remake (we don't have a fancy title yet) is an attempt to recreate original &quot;Knights and Merchants: The Shattered Kingdom&quot; strategy game.
This is the first demo featuring the economy part of the game.<br>
You wake up in a medieval age in a land ruled by a king. Your goal is to build 
your own kingdom. You don't have direct control for it's not a leaders job to 
sort out such small matters. You control really important things: economy, 
building and later on - army.<br>
KaM Remake is freeware<span style="background-color: #FF0000">(?) Suits me. Opensource is another option, but we can't call it that while the source is closed during development. Freeware is good enough for now. To be deleted</span> and is 
built by enthusiasts. Applications used: Delphi6, OpenGL, OpenAL, zLib,
<span style="background-color: #FF0000">what else? Nothing else important. Icon studio? Hardly worth mentioning. To be deleted</span></font></p>

<p><font face="Calibri">Windows 98, XP or Vista, a 500MHz or faster processor, 256MB or more of RAM, a 3D graphics accelerator OpenGL 1.4 compliant.

</blockquote>
<p><font face="Calibri">Run <b>setup.exe</b> and follow the installation 
instructions.<br>
Package also includes OpenAL audio drivers (<b>oalinst.exe</b>). 
You might need to install them to play the KaM Remake. <br>
KaM Remake uses OpenGL rendering engine, so you need to have OpenGL drivers 
installed as well. Visit your graphics card manufacturer site to get the latest 
drivers available.<br>Launch the game either from desktop shortcut or KaM_Remake.exe in the installation 
folder.<BR>&nbsp;</font></p>

<font face="Calibri"><B>The following shortcuts are available:</B><br>
<b>F8</b> speeds up the game pace<br>
<b>F11 </b>will show up debugging panel and menu<br>
<b>P</b> pauses the game<br>
<b>&#8592;&#8593;&#8594;&#8595;</b> cursor keys will scroll the view in game<br>
<b>Middle mouse click</b> will place a scout at the cursor to allow you to explore<br></font></p>
<p><font face="Calibri"><B>Installing addon maps:</B><br>
<B>1.</B> Create a sub-folder in Maps folder of KaM Remake, name it i.e. &quot;My New Map&quot;.<br>
<B>2.</B> Put inside .dat and .map files of the map and name them accordingly &quot;My New 
<B>3.</B> Map.dat&quot; and &quot;My New Map.map&quot;.<br>
<B>4.</B> You can also make a file called&quot;My New Map.txt&quot; which will contain the description and other information. Use the same format as in the missions provided. No offical format information will be released because this file will probably be changed later on. <span style="background-color: #FF0000">(? or will we just remove the txt file for the demo?)</span><br>
<B>5.</B> File names should exactly match folder name.</font></p>

<font face="Calibri"><B>Silent crashes:</B><br>
KaM Remake silently crashes on loading or music track change if there are any 
problems with sound system. Try installing latest OpenAL drivers. If that 
doesn't help - remove &quot;Music&quot; folder from KaM Remake.<br></p>
<p><B>Low framerate:</B><br>If you have ridiculously low framerate this could mean your OpenGL drivers are 
out of date. See OpenGL version info in main menu top-left corner. It should be 
at least 1.4.x. If it's any less you need to update your graphics card drivers 
(check card manufacturers website for that matter).<br></p>
<p><B>Assertion failed:</B><br>Sometimes when something unexpectedly happen you will get a &quot;Assertion failed&quot; 
message. In this case you should terminate KaM_Remake from Task Manager (press 
Ctrl+Alt+Del, choose KaM Remake and press End Task button). Browse to KaM Remake 
folder and find KaM.log file containing details of the crash. Please send this 
file by email either to Krom (<a href="mailto:kromster80@gmail.com">kromster80@gmail.com</a>) or Lewin (<a href="mailto:lewinjh@gmail.com">lewinjh@gmail.com</a>) along with details of what you did to make it crash and any other information that might be of use.</font><br>
