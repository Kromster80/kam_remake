<p><font face="Calibri">KaM Remake (we don't have a fancy title yet) is an attempt to reinvent original &quot;Knights and Merchants: The Shattered Kingdom&quot; strategy game.
This is the first public limited technology preview (demo) featuring the economy part of the game 
(referred as &quot;mod&quot; or &quot;Remake&quot; further on). Our aim is to demonstrate the 
potential and get feedback on functionality. All included &quot;assets&quot; borrowed from 
KaM are there for testing purposes only. Final release will not include any of 
copyrighted &quot;assets&quot;.<br>
We assume that you own the original KaM game, in other case you should buy it - 
it's available in number of online gaming stores.<br>
KaM Remake executable<span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> (we own only exe 
file, right?) </span>is freeware and is 
built by enthusiasts. Applications used: Delphi6, OpenGL, OpenAL, zLib.</font></p>
<p><font face="Calibri"><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">I think we can put it as follows: KaM 
Remake is a mod (sic!) for original KaM TSK/TPR, some kind of alternative exe. This way 
we rely only on files owned by end user. And as your father noted - this demo is 
a &quot;limited technology preview&quot; only. Later on we could wrap this in a 
way that we upload only KaM_Remake.exe and a script to convert all files/paths 
to Remake format.</span></font></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #FFFF00"><font face="Calibri">Show the text to 
your father once again plz. Least of all we need troubles with copyrights.. And 
I will ask a friend of mine for same matter meanwhile.</font></span></p>
<p><font face="Calibri">You wake up in a medieval age in a land ruled by a king. Your goal is to build 
your own kingdom. You don't have direct control for it's not a leaders job to 
sort out such small matters. You control really important things: economy, 
building and later on - army.</font></p>

<p><font face="Calibri">Unpack all files contained in the package into new 
folder on your PC.<br>
Package includes OpenAL audio drivers (<b>oalinst.exe</b>). 
You might need to install them to play the KaM Remake. Latest version can be 
found on official OpenAl page:
<a href="http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal/default.aspx">
http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal/default.aspx</a> <br>
KaM Remake uses OpenGL rendering engine, so you need to have OpenGL drivers 
installed as well. Visit your graphics card manufacturer site to get the latest 
drivers available.<br>Launch the mod - KaM_Remake.exe.<BR>&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Calibri"><B>Installing addon maps:</B><br><B>1.</B> Create a sub-folder in Maps folder of KaM Remake, name it i.e. &quot;My New Map&quot;.<br>
<B>2.</B> Put inside .dat and .map files of the map and name them accordingly &quot;My New Map.dat&quot; and &quot;My New Map.map&quot;. 
File names should match folder name exactly.<br><B>3.</B> You can also make an 
optional file called &quot;My New Map.txt&quot; which will contain the 
mission description and some other information. Use the same format as in the missions provided 
with Remake. No official format information will be released because this file will probably be changed later on.</font></p>

<font face="Calibri"><B>Silent crashes:</B><br>
KaM Remake silently crashes on loading or music track change if there are any 
problems with Windows sound system. Remove &quot;Music&quot; folder from KaM Remake, 
this should help.<br></p>
<p><B>Low framerate:</B><br>If you have ridiculously low framerate this could mean your OpenGL drivers are 
out of date. See OpenGL version info in main menu top-left corner. It should be 
at least 1.4.x. If it's any less you need to update your graphics card drivers 
(check card manufacturers website for that matter).<br></p>
<p><B>Assertion failed errors:</B><br>Sometimes when something unexpectedly happen you will get a &quot;Assertion failed&quot; 
message. In this case you should terminate KaM_Remake from Task Manager (press 
Ctrl+Alt+Del, choose KaM Remake and press End Task button). Browse to KaM Remake 
folder and find KaM.log file containing details of the crash. Please send this 
file by email either to Krom (<a href="mailto:kromster80@gmail.com">kromster80@gmail.com</a>) or Lewin (<a href="mailto:lewinjh@gmail.com">lewinjh@gmail.com</a>) along with details of what you did to make it crash and any other information that might be of use.</font><br>
