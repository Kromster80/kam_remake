Long, long ago, beyond the mountains, past the forest was a place called "Border Rivers". Our story begins before the events in "Border Rivers". It was then, when the barbarians attacked the "Stone Castle", burned and destroyed it. They killed the king and his people. It was a mistake because the hidden chambers of the castle held many treasures. His secret was hidden under the rubble. Until now, when the legend singing bards tell of a great treasure. Today, the castle is buried under stones. Gather your best men, your people built the beginnings of the village. Expand as much as you need and go after the gold. But you must stop the opponents who also plan to loot the ruins!||The team that is the only one with soldiers in the castle will find treasure every 45 seconds.||Made by PAKER TEAM:|The Viking|Browaar|Luki|Woloszek|PAKER||Script by Lewin
