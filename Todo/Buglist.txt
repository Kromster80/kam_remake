Since r6720:
<===================================================================================>
Bugs:
 +	Lobby map list should show 8 locations at most, since only 8 locations can be used by humans at once
 +	Armour smithy has iron as 1st input, weapon smithy has iron as 2nd input (iron/coal swapped). Would make sense to match them (note: simpply swapping in KM_ResourceHouses causes game logic to be swapped with GUI)
 +	Armour smithy has shields as 2nd output, armour workshop has shields as 1st output. Would make sense to match them (note: simply swapping in KM_ResourceHouses causes game logic to be swapped with GUI)
 +	Disabled controls could have focus and receive keyboard input

	Server welcome message should support Unicode
	Campaign progress from r5503 was lost
	AI sometimes tries to connect a house by road through field plans/diggings, which fails (finished fields are roaded over correctly but not plans/diggings)
	Deliveries should use the actual walking route length (opposed to Radius)
	Archers should step backwards when too close to attack target
	Replays sometimes end up with a mismatch while watching them, cause unknown
	AI attacks make the game lag (by using too much CPU in pathfinding ?). Vortamic is especially bad.
	Remake may be too random at battle results, too much depends on luck (test battle map outcomes with various RandSeed)
	Players that have intentionally quit (not just disconnected) should count as defeated
	Screen resolution selecting is not enabled (see resolution_selector_not_available.jpg). Win lists all resolutions 800x600 .. 1366x768
	Stonemason could stuck on a mountain after flattening (stonebug2.jpg)
	Market cart should be an overlay like flagshtok to prevent duplication of its shadow (rendered when there are no wares)
	Few terrain tiles (4th, 14th) have noticeable seams on their side when looked closely at
	Using F11->File->Open/Edit Mission during an MP game will not unlock the mutex, and thus you can't enter the MP area after that until restarting the game (F11->Stop could cause the same problem?)
	If just one player cannot run the game smoothly MP will lag for everyone in his game. For example if you zoom out a lot you will get a poor frame rate and your game will run at < 10 ticks per second forcing other players down to that speed. The lagger's ping will not look any different. Maybe have a way to indicate to that player and the others on the server that he is causing the lag? Our planned 2x speed in MP will make this much worse as some computers will lag more.
	There's no message in MP when you defeat AI opponent (if you defeat human opponent it shows one)
	Woodcutter would cut a missing tree on a corn field (replaced with corn while he is chopping)
	Towers attack range is uneven (should be measured from towers middle, not the recruit location in BR corner)
	AIAttacks bug (AI attacks mulfunction after 12min.rar)
	TSK 5: ally sometimes sends his troops to the enemy base causing you to lose (after the enemy attacks?)
	When uinstalling KMR, there are a lot of temp files left (.mi, logs, etc)
	House animations order don't match with wares being taken/made. Many times wares dissappear before citizen goes to take them.
	When units exit Barracks and auto-join another group, they change that groups formation
	Warriors who hit an obstacle (diagonal tree) while storming should walk towards leader's final position
	AI groups retaliating to threat or provoked by auto attack range should return to their defence positions after pursuing unsuccessfully for a certain time/distance
	On 2 display setup, when the game is fullscreen cursor should not be locked to that one display.
	On 2 display setup, the game should not scroll the map if cursor is on the second display (windowed or fullscreen)
	Army orientation changes after attack. This is annoying, but sometimes could be vital when armies strike and return for next fight.
	AI does not repair houses after Save/Load
	

	Water looks ugly brown when you zoom out too far due to water tiles having brown checkerboard pattern (anti-aliasing won't help)
	Wooden house frames flicking on Onboard Intel HD Family Chipset (see images "Hidden House Frame Intel Onboard 1.jpg")
	Colored rectangle below cursor


Improvements:
 +	M	Renaming replays in replay menu
 +	L	Allow to customize and save hotkeys settings
 +		Select area to work in for woodcutters

		Dismiss button to make units walk into the school and disappear (gold is not refunded)
	L	Simple dedicated server form which lets you set the properties of the INI for the server and start it [gemGreg]
	L	Placing houses in MP should put a temp/fake visual markup until the real one can be added to make it appear responsive
	L	Ctrl+C/V to copy chat messages with e.g. links or quotes
	L	256x256 icons for EXE (for vista/7/8 users)
	L	Chat logs
	L	Evacuate wares from barracks
	L	Allow chat over multiplayer results screen
	L	Add support for 1024x600 (1280x720) resolution in the map editor
	L	Pack textures into atlases with regard to GPU max supported texture resolution (512 or 1024 px)
	L	Clicking and holding on the add/subtract buttons in weapons workshops could increase the number to save repeated clicking
	L	New command !SKIP_HOUSE. If I want a map with no stone, then after building the inn the woodcutter and tower should become available (skips the stonemason)
	M	Pause in multiplayer (pause by everyone and unpause by at least 2 other players)
	L	"Checkpoints" in replays every 20 minutes or so to allow skipping forwards/backwards (zips entire game state which can be loaded)
			Krom: Not sure how this will cope with 29hour games
			Lewin: We can delete save points as the game goes longer. By the time we reach 29 hours we only keep save points from every 1-2 hours. For 90 minute games we keep one every 10 minutes.
	L	Way to place roads/fields/destroyed buildings belonging to no player (for maps like Battle In The Ruined City where currently the roads don't always show depending on which locations are played) (maybe through special player like animals?
	L	The close door button in a house also stops a new occupant from taking it, so you can make recruits go to the barracks instead of walking to watchtowers, and so you can prioritize for example which mines get occupied first. It should also block the "house not occupied" message.
	LM	Place all the roads for all players, then all the houses for all players, then all the units for all players from the script, repositioning units that are on houses and do floodfill for houses once at the end rather than for each house
	L	Changing teams in multiplayer
			Lewin: When joining a team the team members must "accept" you before it occurs. Leaving a team must also require acceptance I guess, otherwise you can walk into an ally's village and become his enemy, and some people would surely do this. We might also need a "lock teams" option in the lobby for this to work.
	L	Ability to mark maps as a favourite (gold star) so they appear at the top of the list (find your favourite maps without scrolling through whole list)
	L	House not occupied message should mention which house it is ("This farm is not occupied"). Hard to work around plurals and fem/masc forms
	L	Allow dedicated servers to optionally specify their IP in the INI file (some servers have multiple IP addresses, the external one the master server sees might not be the correct one)
	L	Icon before the server name: Swords/house/floppy for battle/build/save (save icon only shown while in lobby)
	L	Maplist takes too long to load on first run, scrollbar moves irritatingly while maps are being added
	L	Save last selected item in lists (load game, mp, maped list, savegames, etc)
	L	Right-click on a unit in Schools queue to move that unit to the front of the queue (currently RMB is "remove to here")
	M	Archers should not change formations when group members get killed while under attack
	L	Allow to block wares delivery into armor workshop, so that player could focus each on certain task (shields or armors)
	L	Keep road bends when neighbour road is destroyed (e.g. house entrances)
	L	Allow fish to swim under the ice (as well render it between sand and water terrain layers)
	L	Allow to copy opponents nikname into buffer (through players menu > Copy?)
	L	Save wares distribution ratios between games
	M	Make projectiles play hit sounds on every Paint and UpdateState, so we dont get just 3 hit sounds for 20 archers shooting at once
	M	Script command to block AI building in certain areas (TSK 14: http://www.knightsandmerchants.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=1254&p=40032#p40032)
	L	Allow changing speed in MP when there's only 1 human (for playing vs AI like it's SP)
	L	Load saved games with double click
	L	Do switching of main game menu tabs with F1-F4 even if settings/save/load sub-menus are open
	M	Self-sustained AI should help allied players in game
	L	Do not change UnitsPerRow of a group that is exiting Barracks if player has manually changed it at least once
	L	Do switching of main game menu tabs with F1-F4 even if settings/save/load sub-menus are open

	L	MapEd: Allow to toggle trees/objects opacity (make them partially visible) [Marcin]
	L	MapEd: Allow to toggle AI defence positions display
	L	MapEd: Random objects brush
	L	MapEd: Artistic brushes (those that place random types of trees and/or decorations)
	L	MapEd: Make houses highlight red when about to erase them as trees/units do
	L	MapEd: Flat terrain checkbox on Extras popup
	L	MapEd: Allow to set troops order destination with mouse on map
	L	MapEd: Add size to Object delete brush (possibly in a new tab where artistic brushes will be)
	L	MapEd: An option to hide roads/fields, so you can view just the terrain while you edit it
	M	MapEd: "Sync all" checkbox when adding wares to a house which makes it the same for all houses of that type
	L	MapEd: Pipette tool like in Photoshop to select the type of tile under the cursor (ctrl+click while in tile mode?)
	L	MapEd: Lasso selection for copy/paste
	L	Add a button into barracks UI to allow to set a rally point
	L	MapEd: Allow to rotate tiles on the map like in Krom's editor
	L	MapEd: allow to grab an object with a MouseDown and drag it around until MouseUp 
 
 -	Fixed "Unsupported global variable type 28" error in dynamic scripts when using UnicodeString (no need to use unicode, use AnsiString)
 -	Make units turn around without skipping inbetween directions (instead of immediate direction change)
 -	Unexpectedly high ping values (not our problem usually)
 -	One type of pine tree cannot be cut (same as KaM, there are not even sprites for it falling down)
 -	The ingame briefing texture is too short, see attached picture
 -	Serfs should take wares back or to suitable house if destination is destroyed
 -	In window mode, the taskbar is over the game window. (thats what it supposed to be, use fullscreen instead)
 -	Warriors attacking enemy citizens don't listen to orders (thats a feature)
 -	Many texts will not change if I change the language in options menu (we are always working on it)

Fixed in r3392:
<===================================================================================>
 +	Range Check Error occurs when a woodcutter considers chopping a tree on the topmost or leftmost edge of the map
 +	Click server A, then quickly click server B. This is incorrectly interpreted as double clicking and you join server B
 +	Units should eat a maximum of 2 food items at the inn
 +	Exporting GUI.rx gives a Range Check Error
 +	Woodcutter would occasionally not cut certain trees
 +	Falling trees sometimes looped back to the first frame of the animation making them appear standing again

 +	Chat button in multiplayer replay viewer was not properly disabled and upon click caused a crash
 +	See-through hills (lighting flaw)
 +	Server selection highlight in MP menu disappears when sorting by any column
 +	Putting a "/" in a save name causes an error (probably other characters like \ ? | too, we should restrict allowed chars)
 +	Entering text into port/room fields. They should accept only digits
 +	Pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL with a game running caused a "System error code 5" or "call to OS function failed" due to Windows denying accesss to Mouse.CursorPos for a moment
 +	Player count for a room should come from host, not the number of clients the server knows about (count can be wrong due to queriers)
 +	Issue with empty saves names and misused whitespaces
 +	The market should be blocked in the original campaigns/tutorial (maybe have an option to enable it starting at later missions, but it still ruins the balance IMO)
 +	Sometimes render order is wrong, using the X/Y values of the sprite gives bad results in some cases
 +	Fixed assert fail when loading map that has roads placed outside of map bounds


Improvements:
 +	Do not allow to run multiple application instances at once to prevent multiplayer cheating
 +	Display height shapes outlines in MapEd
 +	Master server records information about which maps are played
 +	Switching to fullscreen causes banding if drivers report unsupported refresh rates (add manual refresh rate selector to options) [Maciej]

 +	Minimap preview in lobby, singleplayer and map editor menus
 +	Placing road/field in MP should put a temp/fake visual markup until the real one can be added to make it appear responsive

 +	Make fishes/watersnake to be more visible in MapEd

 +	Logs older than 14 days are automatically deleted
 +	Minimap preview for saves (store raw color data at the begining of the save so it's fast)
 +	Saves/Replays scan should be done in separate thread to unlock GUI [Maciej]
 +	Saves/Replays can be sorted
 +	Custom in-game messages for fan-made campaigns and missions (could be stored in new custom .libx file for the mission)

Fixed in KaM Remake Fighting Demo 2010-08-13 (r970):
<===================================================================================>

Fixed in r734:
<===================================================================================>
+	The woodcutters planting animation is not visible, he simply disappears and reappears when he is done planting.
+	The woodcutter doesn't cut down trees, until all the available spots have been planted. In the original KaM a woodcutter would always cut down fullgrown trees in the first place, and only plant trees when there is nothing to cut down. (TRB 2010-02-19 Wood and Swine save01.sav) (trees appeared to be fully grown a few minutes before they can be cut)

+	Range check error in TPR7, (TRB 2010-02-19 Range Check Error.rar) caused by group dying
+	Death task should not wait for action to finish, it should override any action under any circumstances. Otherwise strange things can happen visually e.g. dead units can be "pushed" using interaction sometimes not showing death animation.
+	In game settings uses old sytle brightness control.
+	Main menu options page doesn't refresh if you change the settings in game.
+	After digging house area workers will not continue to walk over other construction sites after leaving the one they made
+	Terrain is now flattened under houses placed at mission start
+	Demolished houses now leave a dug tile where the road used to be, rather than it just disappearing which looked odd (TK's suggestion)
+	F11 statusbar shows wrong map size in loaded games
+	Because the delivery queue prefers closer deliveries, wares will always be delivered to closer buildings. (e.g. with two swine farms, closer one will get all the corn) Same with coal mines. (coal mines in Kuba 2010-02-19 Stuck Workers save09.sav, swine farms in TRB 2010-02-19 Wood and Swine save01.sav)
+	(Can't reproduce, probably caused by worker-construction site issues that have been fixed now) Walk failed in TPR7 "Unit Laborer unable to walk a route from (97;29) to (98;30) during task Idle since the route is unbuilt" (TRB 2010-02-19 Walk Failed.rar)

+	Range Check Error in GetSlide function due to PrevPos being two tiles away from NextPos (fix unconfirmed, but 99% certain) [Lewin]
+	Buggy stone mining - in some maps, e.g. 15 TSK, stonemasons get stuck after grabbing a stone, because of the changing elevation and angle (the tile below them becomes unwalkable). Building a road near the trapped stonemason causes an error message like the described before, but then nothing bad happens - he just go home and keep working.
+	Some saves are impossible to load due to the range check error (bug in TKMPointTagList.Load) [Lewin]
+	Instabilities due to rare circumstances causing routes with canWalkRoad to fail when floodfill succeeds [Lewin]
+	Demolishing the building manually exits from the building menu, unlike in KaM, where it takes back to the building selection [Lewin]
+	Load/Save buttons have different order [to KaM], it's a bit confusing [Lewin]
+	Stuck (trapped) fish (especially in "Across the Desert") would try to use canWalk to solve interaction resulting in crashes [Lewin]
+	Returning to road did not use A* efficiently and so would fail over long distances [Lewin]



Fixed in r565:
<===================================================================================>
Gameplay bugs:
+	Flags are always visible
?	Citizen will try to walk home when it has no road tile below entrance
