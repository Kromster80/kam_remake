This doc contains list of special shortcuts, which are using Ctrl, Shift or other modifiers to alter default behaviour

1)	School training orders. 
	When clicked on train button: 
		-	Left click - add Unit to queue (default behaviour)
		-	Right click fills empty positions of queue with selected unit
		-	Shift+Left click change last unit order to 0. If there was other unit already training, then cancel it and and train selected unit instead. All units in training queue go down to next position in queue (if unit had 2nd position in queue then it become 3rd)
