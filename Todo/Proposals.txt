These are proposals and ideas that have not been decided yet.
If we doubt about something or don't have an agreement about it - idea goes here.
We can discuss proposals in dialog-style
Once an agreement is made or implementation details are made - item is moved to Bugslist.txt improvements section or Refactorings.txt

<===================================================================================>

	L	Add lookout tower armed with endless arrows
	L	Show the mining radius of the selected house or house that you are placing
			Krom: Idea is okay. We need to display mining "strength" (think coalmine) as well, in some nice way, also show ranges of all houses of the same king to allow player to plan his mining better (e.g. avoid overlaps). Iron/Gold don't need this mostly, but Coal/Fish/Towers - do.
			Krom: Another note - mining radies should show effective range with regard to walking length.
			Lewin: Yes showing walking length shouldn't be a problem, we can use GetTilesWithinDistance and highlight the returned tiles. We'll need to "cache" the list so we don't call GetTilesWithinDistance every time we paint (or maybe 1-2ms doesn't matter so much?)
	L	People can cheat in MP during peacetime by digging a house/road over an enemy road or free land (block houses on enemy territory during peacetime?)
			Krom: Easiest implementation seems to be floodfill from towns until areas make borders
			Lewin: Agreed.
	L	AI warriors should automatically engage enemies within 3-4 tiles (happens in KaM?)
			Krom: 2 tiles seems quite enough to me
	L	When player leaves allow his allies to take control over his village and army
	L	Make lobby flag selection using list of countries that speak that language. With English you could choose USA, UK, AU, NZ. With Spanish you could choose Spain, Argentina, Chille.
			Lewin: Sounds ok. Means we need to include ~200 flags I guess, but with RXX packing that's no big problem.
			Krom: Flag represents locale, language that the player can read/type, not an actual location.
			Lewin: The problem is languages don't have flags, countries do. The best we can do is use the country of origin for the flag (e.g. Spain not Argentina, UK not US) Although people use the flag to assume where you are from.
	L	Add a button into MapEd to allow quickplay current map
	L	Change army counts in charts and statistics to army power (e.g. knights worth more than militia)
	L	Allow dedicated server host to do announcements (e.g. server will be closed in 5min, plz save and quit)
	L	Add shortcut keys to common messsages in MP (defend here, attack, check ur base, etc.)
		Allow to cancel wip builders tasks (e.g. roadbuilding)
		Sound notification when MP game starts (some players join the lobby, hit ready and alt-tab waiting for game to start)
		Warriors should resume their last attack order after a fight "ends", so if you ask cavalry to attack archers they do not stop and stand still as soon as the first one dies because the others are not within direct reach. Probably all orders should be remembered and resumed after a fight, so if you ask a warrior to move somewhere and he bumps into a bowman, after killing him he should continue on his way.
			Krom: Is it requested only for Attack orders, or Walk too?
			Lewin: This is already working, right now it happens for attacking and walking which seems good to me.
		Aggressive/defensive stances for soldiers, so they will attack a unit within a few tiles in aggressive mode and only start shooting when the enemy is close in defensive mode
	L	Add a "seperate one unit from the group" button for scouting etc. (we can rearrange interface due to unused move/attack buttons)
	L	Add a way to feed only <30% hungry units
		Switch beacon from B to more convenient Alt+Click as in other RTS?
		Using TAB to toggle between houses of same kind

		In-game player list should show who is defeated (shown seperately to who is disconnected which is already shown by strikethrough)
		Allow to build fields over winefields, allow to destruct own fields and roads by workers.
		Allow to mute certain players in lobby/game
			Krom: Sounds like half-measure against trolls
		Add "plant-only" option to the woodcutter, useful if the woodcutter has some trees but you don't need them cut yet, also for getting your woodcutters in different phases so they are not all choppping/planting in sync (less efficient)
		Clicking on allied soldiers shows a button that enables one to feed his ally's
		Toggle feed button for troops between "feed" and "cancel"
		Ability to set your default color next to your name on MP page (it will be selected in the lobby if available)
		Allow saving from within replays. This would let you create a save of a game at a certain moment and continue playing from there, which could be good for practice (e.g. town building) or fun.
		Invisible links between water bodies to connect water under bridges
		Allow to start Remake with commandline parameters to autoconnect to MP server .\KamRemake.exe -ip 10.3.6.241 -port 2325 -room 0
	L	Serfs that are f.e. taking corn to the mill should claim/lock a flour in the output before arriving, rather than only checking it when arriving (which usually means another serf takes it)
			Krom: I dont think this is a good idea, that could slow deliveries down
			Lewin: IMO it won't in almost all cases, it allows serfs to be more efficiently allocated. Remember that only 1 item is locked per serf bringing an item there, so only a few items will get locked. Right now it's very annoying when a serf drops something off and doesn't take an item out, and a serf from a long way away is made to walk there and take it instead. It also reduces overall traffic on the road networks. I think we could test it on Rayzel's map and see whether it's more efficient (compare overall productivity and average number of idle serfs?).
			Krom: Yeah, but think about opposite situation, when ware is locked by a unit far away, and there are closer units that can take it
	L	Pressing tab should cycle to next edit box (needs TabOrder like Delphi controls?), pressing Enter - click default button
		Placing beacons in replays for educational purposes (e.g. while making a video for youtube)
		Limit rate of the message notification sound to avoid sound spam when you lost many villagers
		Add "Attack ground" for archers
		Remove current group button in MapEd in Groups panel
		MP chat, option to write to Spectators only
		Minimap modes to see allies in green, enemies in red
		Show warriors types icons when T key is held
		Campaign builder could allow overriding the map flag/dot icons (or at least change their colors)
	L	Option in the lobby to select starting with a small village, everything up to sawmill (placed automatically by city builder?)
			Andreus: What about adding some village planning modes, like in KAM MissionEditor (Nothing, Buildings, Buildings and troops)?
	L	Add more Unicode characters to fonts such as misc symbols (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscellaneous_Symbols)

        L       MapEd: Height indicator to make sure that f.e. walls have the same height

        L       ScriptValidator: Drag'n'Drop to open needed script file without browsing

        L       ScriptValidator: Show all (or just 5-10?) errors/mistakes at once to make fixing them easier
		Priority button to focus builders attention on a house


REJECTED:
 -	Archers on a hill get slightly longer range (calculated from height of archer tile relative to target tile)
		not sure about this one. Probably ruins balance and feel of KaM
 -	Try extending height to 0..255 rather than 0..100 so it's easier to have multiple "levels" on a map (e.g. plateau with a hill on it)
		Krom: I disagree. This is not as simple as a matter of just extending it. We need to discuss
 -	Do not send a Recruit to WatchTower when Player has built it but did not connected it with road
		Krom: I think that makes good sense. But if Player made 10 towers and 10 recruits and only then connected them with roads - will/should recruits walk from Barracks to Towers?
		Lewin: The only case this can happen is when the player starts with the towers right? You can't build a house without connecting it to road. I think it's ok for the recruits to go to the towers, but stones definitely should not.
		Rejection reason: Map maker can fill towers with rocks at the start, so recruits are useful
 -	Separate crash situations into gameplay (stop the game because recovery is impossible due to wrongful game state after unfinished UpdateState) and UI (where recovery is much more likely)
 -	Value of resources at the market increases as you buy them and decreases as you sell them to prevent exploiting? (Age of Empires style)
		Lewin: With peacetime of at least 1 hour I haven't heard of market exploits being more profitable than normal play
		Krom: I think our prices are good as they are (just add some tweaks to bread/sausages cost)
 -	Add soldiers counts to statistics page in game (take icons from MapEd)
		Krom: That could be too much detail without real need
 -	Add fan-made section where fans could add LOLCat, Welsh, Simple English, Funny and other translations with fallback to existing locale
 - 	Select multiple saves at once to be deleted (click+drag or hold shift/ctrl)
 -	Gameplay mutators in multiplayer: no iron, no archers, no market, no towers, etc. Host can select multiple mutators. (will fragmentate multiplayer too much)
 -		KaM Launcher that will do automatic game client updates (much complication over nothing)
